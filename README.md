### Description

Tired of writing readme files for your programs? Fear not, for there is now a generator for you to compile them with the ease. This may seem like a simple process, but it will save you time in the long run. The code is quite simple, and I use classes extensively, so if you want to learn classes check this out. It has a previewer, save function (obviously), and it is easy to use. Code is easy to read; this may actually help you out!
